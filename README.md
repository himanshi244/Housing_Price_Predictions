**US Housing Price Prediction**

Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting US housing prices using various economic indicators. The goal is to build a regression model that accurately predicts housing prices based on key factors influencing the real estate market.

Data Sources

The data for this project has been sourced from two primary sources:

FRED Economic Data

Census Bureau New Residential Sales

Factors Analyzed

The following factors have been analyzed to predict housing prices:

Homes for Sale

Homes Sold

Federal Funds Rate

Disposable Personal Income

Mortgage Rates

Unemployment

USA GDP

Housing Starts

Months of Supply

Building Permits (Number)

Methodology----

Data Collection

Data was collected from FRED Economic Data and the Census Bureau New Residential Sales. The datasets were cleaned, preprocessed, and merged to form a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

Model Building

A regression model was employed to predict housing prices. The model was trained and tested on historical data, with performance metrics evaluated to determine the model's accuracy.

Analysis

The regression model analyzed the impact of the following factors on housing prices:

Homes for Sale: Inventory levels indicating supply in the housing market.

Homes Sold: Number of homes sold, indicating demand.

Federal Funds Rate: Interest rates influencing borrowing costs.

Disposable Personal Income: Income available to households after taxes.

Mortgage Rates: Interest rates on home loans affecting affordability.

Unemployment: Economic stability and job market health.

USA GDP: Overall economic health.

Housing Starts: New residential construction activity.

Months of Supply: Balance between supply and demand in the housing market.

Building Permits (Number): Indicator of future housing supply.

Results

The model's predictions were evaluated against actual housing prices to assess accuracy. The analysis provided insights into which factors most significantly impact housing prices.


Conclusion

This project demonstrates the utility of regression models in predicting housing prices based on various economic indicators. The insights gained can help in understanding market trends and making informed decisions in the real estate market.
